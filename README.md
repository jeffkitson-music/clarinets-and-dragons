### Abstract: A Pedagogy of Gamification To Reach Disengaged Students

Jayden couldn't be bothered with his clarinet lessons. Traditional teaching strategies weren't working. That is until he became Sir Clarinetto, a hero defending the town of Sharpsburg from all manner of musical mayhem. All it took was a pair of dice and a little creativity.

Incorporating role-playing game mechanics into lessons, students embark on musical adventures where they overcome challenges and trials by performing specific musical techniques - long tones become tests of courage, scales transform into battles against dissonant creatures, and mastered repertoire may at long last vanquish the forces of discord.

This session will showcase the core mechanics of "Clarinets and Dragons," demonstrate its application in lessons, and provide materials and ideas for instructors wishing to use gamification to reach disengaged students.

While "Clarinets and Dragons" is for teachers and students of all ages, this presentation will be of particular interest to instructors working with students aged 11-15.
