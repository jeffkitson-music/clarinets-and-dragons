# ü§ù Contributing Adventures and Lore
Welcome to the "Clarinets and Dragons" adventure contribution guidelines! We're thrilled you're interested in helping! 

TL;DR: 
* This game is designed specifically for **clarinet students aged 11-15**. Keep this audience (both appropriate content and skill level) in mind.

* Stick to established ("canon") character traits and lore. 

* This is **not** true D&D. Content should be designed to enhance a music lesson, not overtake it. Don't over-complicate.
  
* Content should be highly flexible and inclusive.

* Have a cool idea that doesn't quite fit this? Reach out to the creators to discuss.

## :black_nib: General Guidelines for Contributing Adventures

*   **Target Audience:** All adventures must be designed for **clarinet students aged 11-15**. The challenges, language, and themes should be appropriate and engaging for this age group.
  
*   **Content Policy:** **No adult content** (e.g., violence, language, or themes unsuitable for a middle-school audience). Keep the adventures **family-friendly and positive**, focusing on musical growth and adventure.
  
*   **Adherence to Format:** Please follow the established structure of existing adventures. This typically includes:
    *   **Characters:** Typically Sir Clarinetto the Bold and Professor Forte, but other adventures with the inhabitants of Sharpsburg are welcome. 
    *   **Setting:** Start or involve Sharpsburg and the Lyrebird Academy.
    *   **Story:** A clear problem related to music that needs solving.
    *   **Trials:** Typically a series of 3-4 challenges ("trials"), each focusing on a specific clarinet skill (long tones, scales, and repertoire).
    *   **Boss Encounter:** A final confrontation related to the musical problem.
    *   **Rewards/Loot:** Optional and always at the teacher's discretion. In-game rewards (e.g., magical enhancements, new understanding) are best. Individual teachers should never be required to purchase or supply real world items for their students, therefore **IRL LOOT IS PROHIBITED IN ADVENTURES** (no candy, etc.).  
    *   **Citation:** Please include an author/source, including if the adventure was generated by A.I. (partially or in-full).
  
*   **Clarity and Readability:** Write clearly and concisely. Use bolding, bullet points, and paragraphs to make your adventure easy to read and understand. Markdown language is preferred.
  
*   **Originality:** While the core characters and setting remain, we encourage **unique and creative new musical challenges, adversaries, and settings** to keep the game fresh and exciting.

### üìñ In-World Guidelines (Lore and Theme Consistency)

To ensure new adventures fit seamlessly into the "Clarinets and Dragons" world, please consider the following:

*   **Recurring Characters:** You are welcome to use the canoncal characters or create your own. Characters use should not conflict with established lore.
  
*   **Musical Problem as the Core Conflict:** Each adventure revolves around a **specific musical problem or threat** that disrupts the harmony or education in the realm. This could be anything from a stolen Melody Stone to corrupted instruments, distorted pitch, or forgotten melodies.
   
*   **Integration of Clarinet Lesson Objectives:** This is a **fundamental aspect** of "Clarinets and Dragons". Each "Trial" in your adventure should directly correspond to and require the mastery of a **specific clarinet technique or musical concept**. Examples include:
    *   **Embouchure and Diaphragmatic Breathing**
    *   **Fingerings and Articulation (Tonguing)**
    *   **Aural Skills (Ear Training) and Sight-Reading**
    *   **Dynamic Control (Volume Variation) and Articulation Techniques**
    *   **Long Tones**
    *   **Scales and Arpeggios**
    *   **Mindful Practice Techniques (Slow Practice, Chunking)**
    *   **Practicing with a Metronome/Rhythmic Control**
    *   **Pitch Matching and Intonation**
    *   **Musical Memory and Phrasing**
    *   **Register Transitions (Chalumeau, Clarion, Altissimo, and the 'Break')**
      
*   **Professor Forte's Role as Guide:** Professor Forte consistently serves as a **mentor and guide**, providing verbal cues, hand signals, and explanations related to the musical objectives. His role is crucial for reinforcing the educational aspects of the game.

*   **Antagonists Themed to Musical Challenges:** The adversaries Sir Clarinetto faces (e.g., Corvus the Crooked, the Imp of Imperfection, Kakophony, Dysphonia, the Amnesiac Aether) are always personifications or sources of the musical problems. This reinforces the core concept.

*   **Rewards Reflect Musical Growth:** The rewards, if used, should align with the musical skills gained, often involving enhanced musical abilities for Sir Clarinetto or discovery of musical artifacts for Professor Forte.
