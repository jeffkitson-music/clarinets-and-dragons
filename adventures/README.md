# Clarinets and Dragons Adventures and Lore

## ‚ö†Ô∏èüöß Sample Adventures
Te sample adventures here are meant to inspire teachers to create their own adventures to fit the unique needs and challenges of every student. They may be used, modified heavily, or ignored completely. Please use whatever fits your teaching context best. In the future, a more formalized structure and offical adventures‚Ñ¢ may be added (or not). For now, let your imagination run wild!

## :card_file_box: How to use these files
Welcome, Dungeon Masters and Maestros! This directory contains the campaigns, adventures, and lore documents for "Clarinets and Dragons." These files are designed to offer a flexible and engaging experience, whether you're a seasoned Dungeon Master or new to the world of role-playing games.
It's Not About Dragons (or Strict Rules!): "Clarinets and Dragons" is a pedagogical method crafted to meet students where they are. The game prioritizes engagement over strict adherence to rules. In fact, the very first "CnD" game used only one die and didn't even have a story! The goal is to spark student interest in their lessons (where they might not have had any) through an exciting, adaptable framework.


* **Explore the Lore Documents (If You Want to Deep Dive)**: We've provided lore documents, including a character list and world lore, for those who want to dive deeper. These can offer crucial context for the adventures, introduce key non-player characters (NPCs), and detail the unique world your students will explore. Understanding this background can significantly enhance your ability to lead the adventures (or create your own!)  and improvise, especially if you have highly enthusiastic students who are "hardcore" about D&D (or CnD!).


* **Adapt and Customize**: Think of these adventures as a springboard, not a rigid script. You're fully encouraged to use them as-is, riff on them, or completely ignore anything that doesn't work for you or your students. Feel free to modify plots, characters, musical challenges, or even the setting to better suit your teaching style and your students' interests. Your primary goal is to foster engagement, so don't hesitate to make these adventures truly your own!


* **Choose Your Adventure**: Each folder within this directory contains a self-contained story. You can run them in any order you prefer, though some might have subtle connections or recurring characters. As more campaigns are added, we'll provide adventure summaries to help you quickly select the best fit for your students' interests or your available time.

##  :round_pushpin: Roadmap
With sufficient interest from teachers, students, and potentially other developers, here is the roadmap: 

### **Adventures**
- ‚úÖ 10 full adventures 
    - enough to fill one per week for the bulk of a semester of lessons
    - Other weeks intentionally open for missed or rescheduled lessons, recital prep, etc. 

- Groups of 10 adventures each formed into "seasons" or "campaigns" (read: approximately a semester-ish worth of content, depending) with a narrative through-line.

- Several one-off themed adventures:
    - Specific musical challenges (technique, repertoire, etc.)
    - Specific issues targeting real-world issues students face (anxiety, depression, etc.) [Note: These should be well-researched, cited, and vetted by a mental health professional]
    - Holidays - either real world and/or ficticious Sharpsburg holidays (think "Winter Veil" from World of Warcraft)

### Lore
- ‚úÖ Start a canonical character list
- ‚úÖ Start a canonical lore document
- Commission/make a map of Sharpsburg and surrounding areas

## üíª Prompting Your Own Adventures

Music teachers are busy people! While you can certainly write your own adventures, if that's not your jam, we encourage you to leverage AI. You can use tools like [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) and [Google NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com) (which helped craft the first ten adventures in this campaign) to generate new "Clarinets and Dragons" adventures. Just remember to vet them before use! Your time is best spent on music, so feel free to let AI handle the fantasy writing (unless you want to do it yourself, of course!).

Feel free to be as creative as possible to spark interest in your students and help them succeed. If you'd like to stick to the "Clarinets and Dragons" canon, here's a sample starting prompt you can edit to achieve your lesson goals:

*I am a clarinet teacher, and I'm playing a Dungeons & Dragons-style game with my student called "Clarinets and Dragons." The game takes place in a town called Sharpsburg at the musically magical Lyrebird Academy. The protagonist hero is Sir Clarinetto the Bold. His guide is Professor Forte, the clarinet teacher at Lyrebird. Adventures in Clarinets and Dragons have three trials: Long Tones, Scales, and Repertoire. Please write a D&D-style adventure using these objectives.*
