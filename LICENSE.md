You can share, adapt, and build upon "Clarinets and Dragons," but only for **non-commercial** purposes. If you create something new based on it, you must license it under these same terms, and you always have to give the original creators credit.

This does **not** prevent the original creators from also selling our game or licensing it commercially to other entities under different terms. With the Creative Commons license, we are licensing a specific set of permissions to the public, while retaining all of our other commercial rights as the copyright holder.

**TL;DR**: We can sell our content. You can't. You have to credit us if you use it.
